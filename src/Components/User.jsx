        As a full-stack developer, Danay has been collaborating with a variety
        of companies including small startups and big communities, which has
        made him intimately familiar with all the stages of the web lifecycle
        from the initial architecture to final deployment. Recently, he has
        worked on several cryptocurrency projects piling up great knowledge on
        blockchain tech. He is also not new to the remote freelancing scene, so
        he is extremely flexible with his working hours.
